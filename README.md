# pivalueapproximation

An approximation of pi value using a visual method

This method can be easily explained :

Let c be the side of the window

The area of the window is c . c = c²

The radius of the circle is c / 2

The area of the circle is π . ( c / 2 ) ² = ( π . c²) / 4

If we consider the quotient of the circle's area and the window's area we have ( π . c²) / (c² . 4) = π / 4

That's the value we are approaching using the method in this program. To obtain the value of pi on top of the window, we are multiplying this value by 4
